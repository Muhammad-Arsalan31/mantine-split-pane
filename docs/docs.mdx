import { InstallScript } from './components/InstallScript/InstallScript';
import * as demos from './demos';

## Installation

<InstallScript packages="@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane" />

After installation import package styles at the root of your application:

```tsx
import '@gfazioli/mantine-split-pane/styles.css';
```

## Usage

The main component for creating a Split pane is `Split`, which accepts two or more children, `Split.Pane`.
Below a very basic example with the main props:

<Demo data={demos.configurator} />

> To allow maximum flexibility in the layout, the various panels do not add padding or margins, so these aspects need to be managed manually.

## Pane

The `Split.Pane` component is a child component of `Split` and allows setting some props for panel management.

<Demo data={demos.pane} />

As you can see, it is possible to set the `color` and `hoverColor` props directly from the `Split.Pane` component.

> Obviously, you cannot set the `minWidth` and `maxWidth` from the `Split` component, as these props are specific to each individual `Split.Pane`.


```tsx
<Split color="red">
  <Split.Pane hoverColor="blue">
    <h1>Pane 1</h1>
  </Split.Pane>
  <Split.Pane>
    <h1>Pane 2</h1>
  </Split.Pane>
</Split>
```



## Multiple Panes

You can add as many panes as you want, and you can also set the `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props for each pane.

<Demo data={demos.multiple} />

## Initial sizes

You can set the initial size of the panes using the `initialWidth` and `initialHeight` props.
Obviously, the `initialWidth` will be used for vertical panes, and the `initialHeight` for horizontal panes.

## Min and Max sizes

You can set the minimum and maximum size of the panes using the `minWidth` and `maxWidth` props.
Obviously, the `minWidth` and `maxWidth` will be used for vertical panes, and the `minHeight` and `maxHeight` for horizontal panes.

<Demo data={demos.initials} />

## Nested Split

Of course, you can also nest `Split` components to create more complex layouts.

<Demo data={demos.nested} />

## Nested Split with different props

Now you can appreciate the flexibility of the `Split` component, which allows you to create complex layouts with different props for each `Split` component.

<Demo data={demos.nestedprops} />
